# Power-Plant-EDA
EDA project to explore power plant emissions in the US

Electricity generation is crucial to our daily lives. However, the process of generating electricity is often associated with many emissions; when primary fuel sources are turned into electricity at the power plants, emissions are an output of the process. One of the many activities monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) involves air quality. In an attempt to plan allocation of resources, regulation of technologies, and identify opportunities for emissions reductions, this paper will analyze a data set containing emissions characteristics of electric power plants in the US for 2010.
The script will work to identify the largest contributors to emissions within the electricity generation sector. It will then identify trends in the emissions data to determine areas to focus improvements and propose regulations that may impact emissions.
